    \textbf{\large Question 1}
    Write a brief note on the meaning of each component of both the structures in\_addr and sockaddr\_in.\\[10pt]
    \textbf{\large Answer}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{struct in\_addr:} This structure contains only one member which is s\_addr of type u\_long type
        for storing the 32 bits IP address which can be netID or hostID.
        \item \textbf{struct sockaddr\_in:} This structure contains 4 members total of 16 bytes. sin\_family that is of 2 bytes of type short and used to 
        store the family type of socket e.g. AF\_INET, AF\_UNIX. sin\_port that is also of 2 bytes of type u\_short (unsigned short) stores port number of
        host machine e.g. 23, 9939. sin\_addr is of 4 byte of type in\_addr that already has been discussed in last point which used to store the
        IP address of host machine. sin\_zero of 8 byte of type char array which may be used in future or can be used to extra info about address.
    \end{itemize}
